
1.  My approach of solving this issue would be...First I will complete task1 and ask to extend the deadline for task2. Simultaneously I will make sure to give enough priority to my family because of the 
 emergency, and after that issue will be resolved then I will focus on task2 and complete that within the extended deadline. I will also inform the regarded people (respective managers/customer) about the emergency and will keep them updated in future as well.

Why have I chosen this approach and the facts considered before making decision:
- Though task1 is of low priority still will take less time to complete as compared to task2.
- On the other hand, task2 is complex and will take more time which is not possible due to family emergency and its unavoidable.
- I have given a chance to extend deadline of only one of the two assignments, so completing one of themis necessary.
- Because of the emergency I may not be able to focus enough on a complex task and deliviring low quality work is bad then delay.
